## CSV Decks
This program uses csv files to get the flashcards for the program. The csv files
are organized as follows:
```term|definition|labels```
- `term`: what you will have to guess
- `definition`: the text on the "front" side of the flashcard
- `labels`: a list of labels (seperated by commas) used to organize the deck and select which cards to study
